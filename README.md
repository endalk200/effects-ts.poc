# Effect-TS POC

A proof-of-concept project for experimenting with the [Effect](https://effect.website/) library in TypeScript.

## Goal

This project serves as a playground to explore and learn the Effect library - a powerful TypeScript library for building type-safe, composable, and concurrent applications with first-class support for error handling, dependency injection, and resource management.

## Prerequisites

- [Devbox](https://www.jetpack.io/devbox/) installed

## Setup

```bash
# Enter devbox shell (installs bun automatically)
devbox shell

# Install dependencies
bun install
```

## Running

```bash
# Run the application
bun run start

# Run in watch mode (auto-reload on changes)
bun run dev
```
